1929. Concatenation of Array

- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/description/
- Difficulty: Easy
- Topics: Array

Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.

Return the array ans.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]
Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]]
- ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]
Output: [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3]]
- ans = [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

UMPIRE Method:

Understand

- Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
- Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
- Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

1. Can the nums array be empty?
2. Any requirement on time/space complexity?

Match

- See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

1. Directly append to the end of the original array
2. Declare a new blank answer array, loop through the given array and append the elements twice to the new array
 
Plan

- Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
- Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

1. Declare a new blank array
2. Iterate through nums array, append the elements twice

Implement

- Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

See solution.py

Review

- Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
- Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

Evaluate

- Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
- Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

Assume N represents the number of items in the array.

- Time complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(N)
